# Pit-Stop-1

**Assignment 1,2,3**

## Assignment 1

This project uses a portion of the first chapter of *Alice in Wonderland*, extracted from a PDF file and converted into Markdown format.
To achive a better control over the text, during the conversion process - in addition to standard Markdown - some HTML elements were used to achieve better control over text formatting:

- &nbsp, was used to insert a space at the beginning of certain paragraphs, recreating the indentation found in the original formatting.
- br, was used to create a line break without adding extra spacing between paragraphs, allowing for more precise control.

These additions help reproduce the structure of the original PDF text more faithfully.

Additionally, I attempted to use HTML to justify the text, but doing so caused the Markdown editor to stop interpreting Markdown syntax correctly—for example, asterisks for italics were no longer recognized. For this reason, I chose not to apply full justification.
